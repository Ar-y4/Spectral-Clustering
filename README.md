## Spectral-Clustering
# spectral clustering from scratch (calculated Fiedlervalue and Fiedlervector using QR method and Shifted Inverse Power method)

I designed this for the Linear Algebra course at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad for the Fall 2022 semester.
`FUM-Linear-Algebra-01-02-1-Lab#03.ipynb` is the version for students to complete.
I will upload the full version after the deadline for students.
