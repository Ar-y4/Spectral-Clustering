# Spectral-Clustering
### spectral clustering from scratch (calculated Fiedlervalue and Fiedlervector using QR method and Shifted Inverse Power method)

I designed this project as my teaching assistant job for the Linear Algebra course in the Computer Engineering department at the Ferdowsi University of Mashhad for the Fall 2022 semester.\
`FUM-Linear-Algebra-01-02-1-Lab#03.ipynb` is the version for the students to complete and `Spectral_Clustering.ipynb` is the complete version.
